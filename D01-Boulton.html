    <h1> William Boulton's Design Principles </h1>
    <hr>

    <div class="principles">
    <h2> Key Design Principles </h2>

    <ul>

        <li> Listen to user feedback. </li>
        <li> Include accessibility options for users. </li>
        <li> Have consistency across all pages and menus. </li>
        <li> All content should be visible to the users. </li>
        <li> Use constraints to prevent users from accessing certain options. </li>

    </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="principles">
    <h2> Conceptual Design Principles </h2>

    <ul>

        <li> Have a purpose when designing the conceptual model. </li>
        <li> Let the technology of the product be determined by the model, not the model determined by the technology. </li>
        <li> Avoid creating models that are too complicated. </li>
        <li> Ensure that the model is in line with the original vision of the product. </li>
        <li> If a model no longer fits the vision of the product, rework it. </li>

    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="principles">
        <h2> User Focused Design Principles </h2>
    
        <ul>
    
            <li> Do not make too many system changes all at once. </li>
            <li> Be mindful of how changes will affect the current user experience. </li>
            <li> If a new version must be released, allow users to stay on the old version for a certain amount of time. </li>
            <li> Put the user first. </li>
            <li> Design with the user's needs in mind. </li>
            <li> Allow your product to communicate with its users. </li>
            <li> Anticipate the expectations of your users. </li>
    
        </ul>
        </div>
    
    <div class="principles">
        <h2> Accesibility Design Principles </h2>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li> Be mindful of the different ways users will experience your product. </li>
            <li> Include accessible alternatives for certain actions. </li>
            <li> Avoid the use of flashing lights and loud noises. </li>
            <li> Make your product as understandable and robust as possible. </li>
            <li> Ensure that your product is always operable. </li>
        
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="principles">
        <h2> Technical Design Principles </h2>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li> Ensure the code of the program is well formatted and well commented. </li>
            <li> Use automatic testing to speed up the testing process. </li>
            <li> Reduce the chance of user error by as much as possible. </li>
            <li> If an error does occur, take the blame away from the user. </li>
            <li> Create error messages that are not vague and explain the problem. </li>
            <li> Allow users to report any problems they encounter. </li>
        
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="principles" style="margin-top: -165px;">
        <h2> Cosmetic Design Principles </h2>
    
        <ul>
    
            <li> Use a logo that is easy to read and works well when it is large or small. </li>
            <li> Use a distinct color scheme throughout your entire product. </li>
            <li> When choosing a font, choose one that is readable but captures the vision of your product. </li>
            <li> Avoid using colors that don't work well together, such as yellow and white. </li>
            <li> Don't cram too much information in one spot - space it out. </li>
            <li> Ensure that the product looks consistent across different devices. </li>
            <li> Have icons that are readable and easy to understand at a glance. </li>
    
        </ul>
        </div>
